    <p class="hi">A Technical Introduction to <br> Machine Learning</p>
    <p>Hosted by <a href="http://justin-le.github.io/">Justin Le</a></p>
    <br>
    <p>Friday, Oct. 7, 2016</p> <p> 2 to 4pm</p> <p>SEB 3265, UNLV</p>
    <br>
    <p><b>Abstract</b></p>
    <p>In recent years, intelligent algorithms that learn from data have had an enormous impact on empirical research in such diverse areas as medicine, physics, finance, and beyond. Furthermore, these algorithms have been implemented in common programming languages, making them widely accessible to both researchers and developers.</p>
    <p>In this workshop, we'll discuss the concepts and mathematics that underlie these machine learning techniques, as well as the Python libraries that enable us to efficiently apply them in practice. Requiring only a basic familiarity with calculus and programming, the workshop will introduce common challenges in designing, characterizing, and applying machine learning methods with the goal of extracting insights from data.</p>

    <p><b>Prerequisites</b></p>
    <p>Although not necessary, it is strongly recommended that you review the following topics before attending in order to fully benefit from the workshop:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Mathematics: vector/matrix calculations, probability distributions, sums/integrals, gradients</li>
        <li>Programming: basic Linux commands, basic Python commands involving lists and functions</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p><b>Notes</b></p>
    <p>If you wish to follow along with our programming exercises during the workshop, please bring your own laptop with Ubuntu 14.04+ and the following packages:</p>
    <pre><code>
    sudo apt-get install build-essential python-dev python-numpy \
      python-numpy-dev python-scipy libatlas-dev g++ python-matplotlib \
      ipython ipython-notebook
    </pre></code>
    <p>If you use your own distro instead, we cannot offer any support if you encounter issues while executing our code.</p>
